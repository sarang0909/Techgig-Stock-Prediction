'''We have data of 12 diffenret stocks,but we will pick only one for exploration'''
data preporcessing
'''remove rows and  with any null value'''
'''Create new column to show closing price after 30th day'''
Evaluation matrix chosen is Mean Absolute Error/MAE
'''Try out couple of regression models to choose base model'''
'''We wil go with  RandomForestRegressor as base model to help with feature engineering'''

2.Feature Engineering:2_feature_engineering.py
Try diffenret feature using TALib
Evaluate MAE for each featureSelect features which improves MAE
3.Select best model:3_select_best_model.py
Create featured dataset from previous step.

Try different regression model on whole dataset and compare MAE
It turns out out LinearRegression and BayesianRidge perrform better.

Create Training and test set:
KFoldCrossvalidation is not useful in timeseries data.
TimeSeriesSplit is used with 6 fold(6 is decided after trying many otherr values).
For each fold create 1 model.As we have chosen 2 algorithms.
We'll have total 12 models.
'''Now we have 12 predicted values from 12 different models,one way to select final values is averaging output of 12 models
but a biased model can give outlier as result which in turn will afect averaging.
So new approach is considered:Treat output of 12 models as features'''


4.Run final model on test data:4_run_final_model.py
Create new model and consider output of 12 models as features.
Ridge model is considered to give more importance/weight to more correct models from 12 models.
This model will give final value.
Run this model on 4th April data,it'll predict 16th May data.

Create model according to sector
